# BostonHack-Bose
Repo for BostonHack 2019 Bose AR spatial awareness idea

## Current Goal:
Control music volume with head tilting gestures

## Notes:
	https://bosedevs.gitbook.io/bose-ar-android-workshop/
	
### Sensors:
	Accelerometer
	Gyroscope
	magnetometer

	Rotation:
	-Measures the orientation of the device relative to magnetic north
	-Uses the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to derive the orientation value
	-Provides 4-dimension quaternion values
	-Quaternions emitted by the SDK are unit quaternions with a norm of 1
	-Unitless
